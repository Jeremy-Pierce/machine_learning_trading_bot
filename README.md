# machine_learning_trading_bot
Creating an algorithmic trading bot that learns and adapts to new data and evolving markets by utilizing Python programming and machine learning.

I used a SVM model as the baseline as it appeared to have accurate results when analyzing the data.

The data supports that the SVM slightly outperformed the LogisticRegression method. This is confirmed in the backtest prediction results with an accuracy score of 52.
